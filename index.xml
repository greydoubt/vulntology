Semantics An action involves one or more high-level impact methods which occur in a specific affected context. Actions can result in impacts to the affected context. If multiple contexts are affected there will be multiple actions, with each action relating to a specific affected context.
Properties An action has the following properties.</description></item><item><title>Barrier</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/vulntology/specification/objects/barrier/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/vulntology/specification/objects/barrier/</guid><description>Barrier Object A barrier can be any characteristic inherent in the vulnerability that could impede the adversary from achieving successful exploitation or a protection mechanism that may limit the actions or impact that can be taken even if the vulnerability is able to be exploited. These are often part of the system in which the product is deployed or are inherent in how the product is used.
Properties A barrier defines the following properties.</description></item><item><title>Barrier Type</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/vulntology/specification/values/barrier-type/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/vulntology/specification/values/barrier-type/</guid><description>Barrier Types There are multiple types of Barriers and each type has one or more subtypes which represent concepts more nuanced than their parent types.
Authentication/Authorization:
Impersonation: Encryption: Data or access to communication is protected through a mechanism that converts information into code or cipher. On Path: An adversary must position themselves inside a communication channel between two or more parties. This is usually accomplished by exploiting a trust mechanism and tricking both ends of the communication channel into believing that they are communicating with the intended party.</description></item><item><title>Context</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/vulntology/specification/values/context/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/vulntology/specification/values/context/</guid><description>Context Values The conceptual entity where the impacts are realized from successful exploitation of a security vulnerability. Different impacts can be realized by multiple contexts from multiple scenarios.
Values Application: A program designed and implemented to accomplish a specific task. Applications can run on or within operating systems, firmware or other applications. Container: A packaged set of software containing the necessary artifacts to execute in a container hosting environment, which is typically independent from a host operating system.</description></item><item><title>Criticality</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/vulntology/specification/values/criticality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/vulntology/specification/values/criticality/</guid><description>Criticality Values A measure of the relative importance of the associated Scope. This is most relevant when Scope has a value of Limited. When Scope is Limited, Criticality MUST be used in order to provide additional information about its importance. Alternatively, if Scope is Unlimited, Criticality SHOULD be considered as High. Criticality MUST be considered in concert with the Context to which it is associated. That is, for a given Context (such as Guest OS or Application), the Criticality should reflect how significant an associated impact could be for the specific Context.</description></item><item><title>Engineering Method</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/vulntology/specification/values/engineering-method/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/vulntology/specification/values/engineering-method/</guid><description>Engineering Method Values The method or mechanism used to manipulate a user into interacting with a malicious resource.

The abstraction is only for the sake of discussing the vulnerability and is not intended to communicate the actual granular privileges that exist in most information system environments. Privilege Level MUST be considered in concert with the Context to which it is relevant. That is, for a given Context (such as Guest OS or Application), the Privilege Level SHOULD reflect a reasonably appropriate mapping based on the security posture of the specific Context.</description></item><item><title>Product</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/vulntology/specification/objects/product/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/vulntology/specification/objects/product/</guid><description>Product Object The software and/or hardware configurations that are known to be vulnerable to exploitation of the vulnerability scenario.

A Vulnerability must have a least one Scenario, with multiple possible Scenarios being common. A single Vulnerability can likely be exploited by many different approaches with possible varying impacts. Multiple Scenarios can be used to describe these variations. For example, a remote exploit could rely on user interaction to be downloaded whilst a local attacker could use the same vulnerability to obtain the same or similar impact.</description></item><item><title>Scope</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/vulntology/specification/values/scope/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/vulntology/specification/values/scope/</guid><description>Scope Values A coarse measure of the level of impact an exploit could have on a target. In some cases, an impact has no constraints at all. An example of this is a vulnerability with a Read (Direct) Logical Impact association in which the adversary has access to the entire system, and thus has no constraints. In other cases, an Impact might have some constraints in place. An example of this would be a Write (Direct) Impact where the attacker is able to modify resources only accessible by the user.</description></item><item><title>Sector of Interest</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/vulntology/specification/values/sector-of-interest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/vulntology/specification/values/sector-of-interest/</guid><description>Sector of Interest Values Supplemental information identifying potential sectors of industry or use cases where the Vulnerability could have an impact.
